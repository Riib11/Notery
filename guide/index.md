# Notery - The Guide

## Goals

Notery's goals are to implement the following into a LaTex-like program:

- __Modularity__ of packages, Linux-philosophy style; each package can easily do something small that interacts with everything else modularly and in a straighforward manner (less conflicting package issues like in LaTex!).
- __Customizability__ of each and every thing about a document's resulting appearance, without having to mess with endless built-in and undecypherable parameters.
- __Scripting__ at any scale of complexity; easy to write in quickly and easy to seperate into a package of its own.
- __Copypasterino-Friendly__ via not having endless reserved characters! Don't you just have the arbitraryness of the reserved characters in LaTex? I mean, sometimes being able to type a `^` rather than perhaps a `\^` can feel like a neat feature, but overall its really just restrictive especially when it comes to the others like `[], {}, &, %, etc.` Notery has just one reserved character, the familiar `\`.

## Syntax

There are two types of strings you can write in a notery file:

Code strings: start with a `\`.
Normal strings: start with anything else.
